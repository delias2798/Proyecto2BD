asd support,"the app allows users to converse with gemini as if they were in an applied behavioural therapy session for individuals with autism to improve their social skills and be monitored for repetitive/harmful behaviours. the topics of conversation and behaviours exhibited are stored to later be reviewed by friends, family, or therapists to guide the individual’s treatment plans. since therapy sessions tend to be expensive and infrequent, this application could help struggling families support family members with autism.
the conversational format is achieved thanks to gemini’s unique ability to evaluate both visual and audio data. during the conversation, image frames and audio files are uploaded to the gemini api. gemini evaluates the frames and audio together, allowing gemini to evaluate and respond to physical and auditory actions of the individual such as facial expressions, vocal inflections, pronunciation, and more. for example, gemini can make note of a harmful behaviour (hitting oneself) and also for how many frames it occurred for. over time, progress can be evaluated by how much a behaviour is reduced, measured by having the behaviour occur over less frames (time).
on firebase, the chat transcripts and noted behaviours are stored for each session. upon request, the session data can be provided to gemini to summarize for parents or therapists. this helps bring the individuals activities to the attention of others who could use the information to help them better.","android, firebase",edgar martinez,canada

thank you to my parents who volunteered to test this app out and appear in this video. my step mother jen had 8/10 hip pain. by the end of the exercises her hip was pain free! my dad, tony, has significant pain. we focused on his tailbone pain. while it did not completely go away, it was dramatically reduced. he asked, ""what are you doing to me?"" i told him it was gemini who was helping!

if we visualize ourselves as pain free, and especially in the presence of good neurotransmitters we can teach our brains to create new, healthy, pain-free pathways.


for more on my theories regarding the brain and its potential to heal, here is a document to read:

perspective,"information on the internet is often scattered and segmented, making it easy for bad actors to manipulate content, such as cropping images and sharing them out of context. fact-checking typically requires significant time and effort, leading to inconsistent conclusions among individuals who perform their own research. we identified two main issues: fragmented information and the high cost of becoming informed. to address these, we built an ai-powered system and platform that automates research and consolidates fact-checking resources. users can select a post, image, or article to get additional context. our backend, using gemini, searches for information and compiles reliable sources to identify missing context or falsehoods. if the content hasn’t been explored before, it’s stored in a vector database; if it has, we retrieve the existing analysis. the plugin’s side-panel displays the additional context, sources, and websites with similar images. the user can click on the discuss button to open the result on the website, where the community evaluates the ai’s analysis through upvotes and downvotes on the sources used. once a re-evaluation point is triggered (can be based on number of views, interactions, upvotes and downvotes etc.), gemini will re-evaluate its analysis based on the community contribution. the ai’s analysis is versioned. this means that any user can browse through the timeline to see what the iteration of analysis looked like, along with any source update.","web/chrome, firebase, vision api",hellothere,canada

toebeans,"toebeans is a fun app for getting different types of fortunes for your pet cat. it can generate paw readings, horoscopes, tell you about their past lives, and you can ask it some predefined questions. the app is currently a work-in-progress, and is planned to be released in the fall. toebeans is a compose multiplatform app that targets both android and ios. on the android side it uses mediapipe's object detection to detect the cats paws either by consuming the camera feed or from a selected image.

once we have a picture of the paw (toebeans) the user can then get different fortunes for their cat. on android it uses vertexai and gemini to generate the response from the given fortune prompt. on ios it uses firebase functions to call the gemini api. this is done because currently the vertexai package for ios is written in swift and not compatible with kotlin multiplatform. toebeans also uses firebase remote config to be able to adjust the prompt parameters and model settings remotely. as well as firebase auth for user authentication (currently disabled).

the user is also able to ""modify"" their original fortune response to a different type. the app then takes the original response and tells gemini to rewrite it in a different style.

the plan for the future is to use genkit instead of vertexai and firebase functions. we are also in the process of tuning a gemini model by using the ai studio.","android, firebase, mediapipe",toebeans,canada
vivaeval,"vivaeval is designed to improve the lives of middle and high school teachers. it automates the testing and evaluation process with a type of test / assignment that cannot be easily compromised by readily available llms. this should save our overworked teachers 5-10 hours per week.
when the test begins, vivaeval asks the student (or user) a question and awaits a response. at this point, the app uses gemini 1.5 pro to:
1. create the transcript of the audio input. (i didn’t use the audio input directly since it’s easier/faster to keep track of the entire conversation via text).
2. conduct a sanity check to ensure that the user is not trying to access the prompt or say something irrelevant. 3. come up with a response to the user's input; considering the conversation so far and the test outline given by the teacher.
the response is then synthesized to an audio file. when the user is done answering all questions, they are prompted to hit “end conversation”. at this point the app has 1or 2 calls to the gemini 1.5 pro api to: 1. go through the transcript of the conversation and the grading rubric; and assign a score for each point that was supposed to be covered in each question. then compile the results into a json.
2. on some occasions the ‘json’ created in the previous point is not ‘parsable’; and so the app asks gemini to correct the json structure.

work buildup,"no plan survives contact with reality.
the only benefit of planning lies in the forward-thinking process itself. however, a plan's usefulness diminishes rapidly if it remains unchanged. to maintain its value, a plan must continuously evolve in response to new information and changing circumstances. plans have to be thoughtfully complete, yet need to be constantly adaptive to be of the most use.
workbuildup is an approachable project planning tool to:
- quickly decompose complex project work into smaller, more bite size tasks, as well as quickly articulate realistic expectations based on current knowledge of a project,
- encourage constant iterative planning and project tracking through extremely easy viewing and updating, and highlight the consequences of changes to the work plan as new information is discovered. - provide immediate visual feedback on progress and potential hotspots in the work.
- for those who are on the front line, as well as all those in between, the work breakdown structure provides context so there is a better understanding of the ""why"" behind the work.
google gemini powers the workbuildup task generation process by aiding, in a careful human-in-the-loop way, the breakdown of work into detailed steps at each level. this dramatically accelerates the planning process and allows users to very quickly craft the details of work, sometimes even capturing work that wasn't previously considered or was outside the mind-frame of the user. demo avail: aug 8",web/chrome,hallofthought,canada
wunderous,"wunderous explores an idea related to multi-agent ai conversations, but in different direction: connecting multiple humans through a single gemini instance that acts as a mediator among them e.g. consider this chat:
- houman: can you tell sara that i said hi?
- gemini: sure, i will let sara know.
(later)
- sara: any news since we last interacted?
- gemini: yes, houman said hi!
wunderous relies on system instructions to help gemini generate cohesive dialogues, e.g. to avoid an invalid dialogue such as
- houman: can you tell sara that i said hi?
- gemini: sure houman! hey sara, houman is saying hi!
(this is invalid because, from houman's perspective, it's not addressing him, and also because sara might not be interacting with wunderous until much later.)
just as a proof of concept, instructions for interactive stories and textcasting with an audience are included, but the core objective is to provide a toolset for experimenting with various instructions and setups for multi-user generative conversations e.g. a moderated debate room, a journalism channel, etc. the toolset, in particular, includes real-time chat via firebase. i chose gemini flash for content generation as gemini pro can be costly in a long chat with a large token count. however, gemini pro is still used in the 'interaction validator' to validate individual user prompt and flash response pairs, providing json schema-based 'corrective instructions' for flash to retry whenever the pair is evaluated as invalid.","flutter, firebase, gemini, of course :)",wundersmiths,canada
nimmini,"when i was young, i also faced similar challenges because i couldn't read or express myself. my parents' inability to use sign language made me feel the communication during my growth was very painful.

this image-based expression method, which includes assistance for hearing-impaired children, also provides an intuitive communication tool for children with autism and the deaf community. users do not need to manually input text; they can simply click on images to automatically generate dialogues, simplifying the communication process and making self-expression easier.
access to knowledge and information is often quite limited, especially when encountering unfamiliar objects or concepts. however, by taking and uploading photos, users can leverage advanced image recognition technology to identify the names and related information of these items, enabling quick learning and understanding of the surrounding environment.
i've considered that during face-to-face communication, sign language is very intuitive for expressing individual words, but it lacks fluidity when expressing longer sentences, which require organizing words into phrases. by utilizing gemma technology to recognize key words, we can assist special groups in organizing their thoughts, making their expressions more fluent.",android,nimmini,central african republic

camge.org,"the app is based on the theory of personality from florence littauer's book, ""personality plus."" we've refined the questions and answers to ensure a more accurate and engaging experience for users. the app asks users 20 yes or no questions, and then uses the gemini large language model (llm) to generate a personality description based on their answers.
in the gemini competition, we leveraged the knowledge base from the personality test to create a web application that generates 20 yes or no questions. users answer the questions, and then send their answers to the camge app, which uses the gemini llm to generate a personalized personality description.
from a technical perspective, the app is built using angular for the frontend and java spring boot for the backend. the frontend is divided into two components: ""question-ai"" and ""answer-ai."" the ""question-ai"" component calls the ""getsurveyquestions"" service, which generates the questions using gemini. the ""answer-ai"" component prints the final personality evaluation and recommendations for human improvement.
the backend is built using java spring boot, and it calls gemini's rest api using the ""gemini-pro"" model. given the knowledge base from the ""personality plus""; gemini generates 20 yes or no questions. in the second iteration, we send the user's answers to gemini, and it helps us generate a personality description.","web/chrome, angular",camge herbert corredor,colombia
dea for bioinformaticians,"the app is useful to find the most representative gene given a sample. differential expression analysis is a method to decipher the interaction between genes and their environment.

the application is made under a service-based architecture. the “front” uses the flutter sdk, coded in “dart”, the graphical interface requests the csv file where the samples are and you want to find the most representative gene on that “dataset”.

the “backend” is coded in python using “fastapi” libraries and the “uvicorn” web server. the magic of gemini is in the back, using the “langchain” framework. in a first phase, the most representative genes of the different “chunks” are found. once the list of the most representative genes of the different “chunks” is available, gemini is asked to find the most representative gene, giving a description of the process that was carried out and an explanation of the gene found.","flutter, web/chrome",herbert corredor,colombia

1. generate captions for the videos, one of the main complexities of translating videos is maintaining the rhythm of the original video. for example, if we want to translate an english video into german, it is very likely that the translation will have more words and will be longer than the original video. gemini gives the ability to detect when the speaker takes a break and group the caption until a break.
2. generate the translations, again, we want to maintain the rhythm of the original videos. google translate will provide a literal translation of the original sentences. however, we want translations that are more or less the same length as the original video. gemini gives the ability to generate translations with more or less the same number of characters than the original sentence translated.
3. detect which frames need to be lip-synced, we want to send only the frames where the speaker is clearly visible and talking to the lip-syncing ai model. if we send frames with no visible face to the ai, it might crash and fail the lip-syncing process. gemini provides the ability to send the video and receive all the timestamps where the speaker appears in the video.","flutter, firebase",rémy menard,france

ludovik,"ludovik is a mobile app for android and iphone. by taking a photo of a board game's rules, it can provide a short description of the game, summarize the rules, and if needed, you can ask a specific question about a rule and get an answer! no more long interruptions during gameplay to check the rules!

the idea for the app was born at the flip 2024 (festival ludique international de parthenay) in france. we had to test about twenty games to win a small, characteristic plush toy from the festival (a woopy), so we had to immerse ourselves in numerous rulebooks over a weekend, spending a lot of time reading, rereading, and checking the rules. and we thought it would be super convenient to have an app that could do this for us!

as a developer, i couldn't let this idea just sit there, and i took advantage of the competition opportunity to get started. gemini is perfect for reworking the text of the rules that i extract from photos using ocr with google ml kit. i also use gemini pro to manage the rule summary and categorize the game. finally, gemini flash allows me to handle the question-and-answer part of the rules, since i provide it with all the rules, i need less of gemini pro's power, and this allows me to get the answer super fast!

i have many other ideas for growing ludovik where i could use gemini, such as setting up the game, calculating scores by taking photos of the players's plates, etc., etc.

ai shift,"ai shift is a web app that automates and optimizes shift scheduling. simply input your complex workplace rules, and it will generate shifts that meet both employee preferences and operational needs, considering factors like interpersonal relationships and individual circumstances that traditional methods often struggle to handle.

shift creation has long been a complex challenge in workforce management. traditional mathematical optimization methods simply allocate staff numbers to meet basic requirements. however, they cannot handle complex workplace constraints like interpersonal factors, individual preferences, or nuanced company policies.
moreover, relying solely on generative ai for shift creation also presents challenges. while ai excels at understanding shift rules, it struggles with aggregating data and performing the type of mathematical optimizations that traditional methods handle well.

to address these limitations, we've implemented a hybrid chain-of-thought method, where non-ai code performs the statistical analysis that ai typically struggles with, and feeds this aggregated data back to the ai. ai shift overcomes these limitations through this hybrid approach that combines the power of large language models (llms) with specialized non-ai algorithms.

automated image-based measurement tool,"transistors are essential components in integrated circuits, where their performance depends on their structure and material composition. recently, conventional silicon-based cmos logic devices have encountered technical and physical limitations. consequently, many research teams are exploring new semiconductor materials to advance the field.
our project aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to assess the quality of channel samples obtained during the exfoliation step, which is critical in the fabrication process of semiconductor devices based on novel materials. traditionally, these channel samples are observed under an optical microscope or scanning electron microscope (sem), and their width is measured manually using scientific image measurement software.
however, we have designed a website that utilizes the gemini api and image processing techniques to automate this process. users can upload target photos to the api and immediately receive information about the width of the channels and the suitability of the samples for device fabrication. plus, we also created and trained our own datasets for segmentation models based on the unet architecture. we believe this innovation will greatly benefit research teams working on nano devices based on novel semiconductor materials, providing them with significant convenience.",google colab,melvin,south korea

the storage provides gemini with the current folder tree and extracts from uploaded files, which gemini uses to build the optimal folder tree to organise your files.

this requires gemini to be more accurate than ever before.
file systems don't allow much flexibility.
to achieve this, the prompts are structured with a large number of conditions, suggestions and specific response formats.
as well as making sure gemini understood its role, we gave it a long list of do's, don'ts and musts.
both the request and the response were based on json.
this allowed gemini to construct the correct folder tree and actually organise the files accordingly.

once we had the initial idea, we had to decide whether to build it as a system application or on the web.
since most of the miscellaneous files were document files and we didn't know when or where they would be needed, we decided to make it available via the web and that's how we developed it.

the main focus of the project was how to use the llm.

gitwatt,"project name: gitwatt

overview: gitwatt allows users to determine various real-world costs associated with running code from a git repository, including power consumption, carbon footprint, and public cloud expenses.

mechanism:
- git repository analysis: the project analyzes the code components and minimum resource specifications (cpu, ram) needed to run the code. since the gemini api doesn't natively analyze git urls, langchain was utilized.

- cloud instance data collection: for aws, we parsed instance information provided in json format. for gcp, we built a custom web crawler using selenium to collect data by running simulations on the gcp cloud calculator and storing the results in our database.

- efficiency comparison: we compare the specs of aws and gcp instances to analyze power consumption and carbon footprint for running an instance for an hour, using gemini.
scoring and recommendations: the tool then ranks and displays the most efficient cloud instance options for executing the code, based on various cost factors.

- ultimately, gitwatt provides insights into the various costs associated with running git code, including cloud simulation results and real-world expenses.

p.s.
except for the cloud instance data collection and parsing functionality, everything else was built using firebase. the frontend is hosted on firebase app hosting with next.js, the backend is powered by firebase functions 2nd generation (python 3), and firestore is used as the database.","web/chrome, firebase",dutrio,south korea

this is just the beginning. future enhancements will include a five-axis analysis for improved activity and hotel selection, a conversational assistant for setting trip parameters, and tools for booking transport, making itinerai an all-in-one solution for travelers.","flutter, android",punchi samanallu,sri lanka

based on the detected emotion, the gemini api is called to generate a recommendation. the api call requests a short, five-word recommendation tailored to the specific emotion. the recommendations are dynamically generated for each detected emotion: happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise, fear, and disgust.

the captured video frame is displayed with overlay text showing the user's name, age, detected emotion, and the corresponding recommendation from the gemini api. the video feed updates in real-time, continuously analyzing and providing recommendations until the user decides to quit the session by closing the video feed.

the gemini model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is initialized to handle the content generation. for each detected emotion, the model's `generate_content` method is called with a prompt to generate a short recommendation. the generated text is then displayed on the video feed.

additionally, the system stores user data, including name, age, detected emotion, and recommendation, in firebase firestore. the video feed updates every 10 seconds, capturing the current frame, analyzing the emotion, generating a recommendation, and storing the data in firestore.","flutter, web/chrome, firebase",beezgroup,uganda
motherearth,"our web application revolutionizes decision-making for farmers, city authorities, and disaster preparedness teams by providing tailored, location-specific insights. when users select their role—'farmers,' 'city authorities,' or 'disaster preparedness authorities'—the application prompts them for relevant data. for farmers, this includes location and crop types; for others, only location is needed.

deprompto is an ai image interpretation game where google gemini is prompted by a thematic concept, the llm generates a list of keywords, and the player tries to get the llm to describe the player's drawing with inclusive keywords while avoiding exclusive keywords.

a canvas, a color palette, and a radius slider are available to assist with creating the player's drawing.

if the llm uses an inclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player gains 1 point every time the description mentions the inclusive keyword or its plural.

if the llm uses an exclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player loses 1 point every time the description mentions the exclusive keyword or its plural.

if time limits are enabled, the player will only get a prespecified amount of time per round to draw, so prioritize accordingly.

note: because api calls are used in this game, a stable fast internet connection is required.

iris 1,"iris transforms the way people and businesses censor sensitive data in mass.

millions of users share videos on social media everyday. however, the current system struggles to detect and remove sensitive information in real-time. videos containing passwords and personally identifiable information (pii) like addresses, credit card details and ids are frequently taken down only after user reports, which can be too late since the information has already been leaked.

this is where iris steps in. by analyzing visual data for any sensitive data leaks before the video is published, we can solve the problem at its source.

here's how it works: clients upload their videos through an api request. these videos are encrypted in firebase, processed on gcp, and analyzed for sensitive info. our internal database of sensitive info is collected only on the consent of our users, who receive a decrease in their subscription fee. this data will then be deleted after a 30 day retention period. a report is generated, allowing clients to customize blur settings. finally, iris returns a censored video with requested pii blurred.

we use google gemini 1.5 pro to analyze any potential information leak. additionally, we use rag to retrieve any matches to our internal sensitive ino database. google gemini allows us to detect sensitive data from a semantic perspective. so more complex cases of pii and password leakage like mirrored or occluded texts can also be detected.","web/chrome, firebase",iris,united states

we have utilized the ability of gemini to perform the former, where we take the user's queries and combine it with a request to perform flipped interactions. this is done through api calls. the latter is more delicate and not straightforward, and hence we have used several handpicked training examples designed using a combination of gemini and ideas inspired by the psychology literature. thus our model utilizes innate abilities of gemini and questioning patterns suggested by the examples to direct the conversation with the user in a way that best extracts relevant information from the user and guides them to the desirable output.","web/chrome, google docs & google drive","no veni vedi vici, venam vidu machi!",united states

npc dialogue master ai,"npc dialogue master ai streamlines the creation of dynamic and contextually accurate npc dialogue for game developers. the core functionality of our app is to generate rich, evolving npc interactions by leveraging the gemini api, specifically the gemini text model and gemini semantic retrieval.

the process begins with developers structuring their game’s lore using a standard wiki format. gemini semantic retrieval is used to index and categorize this lore, ensuring that all relevant details such as characters, locations, ect, are easily accessible.

using our ui form, developers can define the purpose, personality, and context of each npc by selecting from the same metadata used during the lore upload. this ensures that every dialogue is generated with the most accurate and relevant information. once the npc setup is complete, the ui generates a json object containing all the necessary parameters.

this json object is then integrated into unreal engine, where, during gameplay, semantic retrieval gathers the most relevant context, which is subsequently incorporated into the gemini text model request. this process allows for dynamically generated npc dialogue in real-time, ensuring that npcs consistently reflect the latest updates in the game’s world, without requiring manual script revisions.

npc dialogue master ai thus simplifies the dialogue creation process, enabling developers to maintain narrative consistency while focusing on building engaging and immersive game worlds.",google cloud platform,"javier enriquez, kiefer traub",united states

sport sage,"sport sage builds on the powers of gemini to process short athletic videos. prompting the user for brief pieces of context we then build a useful response to improve athletic performance. the application targets non-experts and is meant to act as a ""rubber duck"" level of help in your pocket. we prioritized fast onboarding and minimal feedback. many folks still find ai and llms intimidating, so we strove to hide as much complexity as possible behind an obvious interface. narrowing the set of things you're asking gemini for helps contextualize the feedback and makes it nearly instantaneously useful.

zwisch,"most high-schools and college campuses lack a culture for carpooling, yet student transportation contributes to the 16% of carbon emissions that come from cars.

why? carpooling is simply not convenient. most ridesharers aren't comfortable sharing a ride with strangers. existing solutions are too time-consuming to setup, riddled with complicated forms and menus.

zwisch organizes carpools within school communities, where trust and safety are key. students can request a ride with a simple sentence.

simply type a sentence or two about your ride details. gemini analyzes your text and matches you with a rider/driver if possible.

the gemini 1.5 pro api converts natural language inputs and creates json ride objects. whenever a new request or offer is created, gemini processes all unfulfilled requests and offers at once, then matches them based on compatibility of route similarity, timing, and your preferences. a ride is created on firebase firestore, and notifications are sent to both users.

zwisch was started by two friends, alessio toniolo and vedic patel who were tired of campus traffic congestion and a lack of easy-to-use apps. alessio (18) is a senior at marist school and vedic (18) is a senior at south forsyth high school. their home of atlanta is notorious for traffic plus a lack of accessible public transportation. the carpooling solution, zwisch, was designed to scale for schools, colleges, and even workplaces to mitigate bad traffic and mitigate the climate crisis.","web/chrome, firebase",alessio toniolo and vedic patel,united states
